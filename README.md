# 🚀 The Dream Debugger Roadmap

> **Current Status:** Day 0 (Starting from scratch)
> **Goal:** Become a Full Stack Developer (Python + React) in 2026.

Welcome to my official learning repository! I am documenting my entire journey from having zero professional experience to getting hired as a Developer.

My strategy is the **Hybrid Method**: I use structured courses (LinkedIn Learning) to understand the *concepts*, and AI (ChatGPT/Gemini) to help me *build* faster.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer: My Learning Rules
1. **Don't Copy-Paste:** If AI writes code, I must be able to explain it line-by-line.
2. **Tutorial Hell:** I will not just watch videos. I must build a project for every concept I learn.
